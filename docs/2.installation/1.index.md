# Installation

You need to choose whether you want to be able to get updates from future versions of ving or not.

## Requirements

Any modern computer should be able to run ving. But you will need to install a couple of things to get started.

 - You'll need to [download](https://nodejs.org/en) and install Node.


## If you want updates: FORK

Choose this option so you can choose to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) the changes from the main ving repo into your repository at any time in the future.


[Fork the ving repo.](https://github.com/plainblack/ving/fork)


After forking, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your forked repo to your computer.


## If you don't want updates: DOWNLOAD

Choose this option if you just want to use ving as a starter and don't care about what happens in the future.

[Download a zip file of the repo.](https://github.com/plainblack/ving/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Then unzip it.

## Either way: RENAME

Then feel free to rename the folder to whatever you are calling your project.

```bash
mv ving my-cool-project
```
