# Email

Ving's email system works over SMTP and is defined using templates created via [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

## Creating an Email Template

### Testing
You can test an email template using the [CLI](cli).

## Sending an Email

## Overriding Outbound Emails

Add an environment variable to override all outbound emails to an email address of your chosing. 

```
EMAIL_TO_OVERRIDE="example@gmail.com"
```

Normally you'd use this in your dev environment so that all your test users email you instead of whatever made up email addresses you might be using. You can add this to your `.env` file.
