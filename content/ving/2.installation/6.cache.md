# Cache

By default ving uses an in-memory cache that goes away every time you restart your server. That's fine for early development, but you get logged out everytime you restart your server, so you're going to want to set up a Redis cache as soon as you can.

## Redis
To use a Redis cache, you must first have a Redis server. Then you simply need to add an entry in .env that points to your Redis server like so:

```
KEYV_PROVIDER_URL="redis://@localhost:6379"
```

You can include a username and password in the URL like so:

```
KEYV_PROVIDER_URL="redis://user:pass@localhost:6379"
```
