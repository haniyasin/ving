# Web UI
The web user interface of ving allows you to build out complex applications using Vue 3. It starts with [automatically generating pages](/ving/ui/pages) for your ving records. We use a component library suite called [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) that provides all kinds of amazing functionality and a styling library called [PrimeFlex](https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex/) that gives you rich power over CSS. But we've also got a bunch of custom [components](/ving/ui/components), [composables](/ving/ui/composables), and [stores](/ving/ui/stores) to help you build your app.
