# Pages
ving is ultimately built on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), so ving pages can do anything [Nuxt Pages](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages) can do.

You can automatically generate a set of pages for interacting with [ving records](/ving/server/ving-record) through the [Rest API](/ving/rest) by using the [CLI](/ving/cli) like this:

```
./ving.ts record --pages=Foo
```

That will give you a place to start, and then you can use the [composables](/ving/ui/composables), [components](/ving/ui/components), and [stores](/ving/ui/stores) we provide to build out a complex app.
