# Server
Everything starts with the [Ving Schema](/ving/server/ving-schema), which defines tables in a database, along with fields, privileges, and other properties. From there you'll generate [Drizzle](/ving/server/drizzle) table definitons. Use those table definitions to create [Ving Records](/ving/server/ving-record). All of those backend services then allow you to create [REST APIs](/ving/rest) and a [UI](/ving/ui) from from Ving Records.
