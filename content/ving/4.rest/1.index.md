# REST
At its foundation ving is a Restful web services interface. This section will tell you about its foundation and how those components relate to each other.

Everything starts with the [Ving Schema](/ving/rest/ving-schema), which defines tables in a database, along with fields, privileges, and other properties. From there you'll generate [Drizzle](/ving/rest/drizzle) table definitons. Use those table definitions to create [Ving Records](/ving/rest/ving-record). And use Ving Records to create [REST APIs](/ving/rest/api).
