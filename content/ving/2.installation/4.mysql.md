# MySQL

You'll need to [download and install a MySQL 8 database](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).

> You could convert ving to Postgres or any other supported Drizzle database, but that's not on our todo list.

## Create the database

Log in to your MySQL database as the root user and then type the following:

```sql
create database ving;
CREATE USER 'ving'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'vingPass';
grant all privileges on ving.* to 'ving'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
```

> Obivously use your own username and password options, not the samples we provided here.

## Create a .env file

Create `.env` in the project root and add your dev database connection string.

```
DATABASE="mysql://ving:vingpass@localhost:3306/ving"
```

> Obivously modify the username, password, and database name to match what you created in the previous step.

## Create the initial tables

Now you can create the initial tables into your database using the [CLI](/ving/cli).

```bash
./ving.ts drizzle --up
```

## Create First User

Also use the [CLI](/ving/cli) to create a user so you can log in to the web interface.

```bash
./ving.ts user --add Admin --email you@domain.com --password=123qwe --admin
```
